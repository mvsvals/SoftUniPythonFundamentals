# Calculate how much plunder the pirates manage to gather.
# Each day they gather the plunder.

# Keep in mind that they attack more ships every third day and add additional plunder to their total gain, which is 50% of the daily plunder.
# Every fifth day the pirates encounter a warship, and after the battle, they lose 30% of their total plunder.

# Output
#     â€¢  In the end, print whether the plunder was successful or not, following the format described above.
# If the gained plunder is more or equal to the target, print the following:
# "Ahoy! {totalPlunder} plunder gained."
# If the gained plunder is less than the target. Calculate the percentage left and print the following:
# "Collected only {percentage}% of the plunder."
# Both numbers should be formatted to the 2nd decimal place.
