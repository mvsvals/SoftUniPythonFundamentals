# Create a program that checks if you can save money for a Disneyland's journey.
# You have a certain number of months during which you can collect the money.
# At the end of each month, you save 25% of the cost of the journey.
# At the beginning of every odd month (except the first one) you spent 16% of the money collected so far on clothes and shoes.
# Every 4th (fourth) month at the beginning of the month your boss gives you Ð° bonus. It is 25% of the money collected so far.
# If you save enough money for the journey, calculate how much money will be left for the souvenirs. Then print the following:
# "Bravo! You can go to Disneyland and you will have {money}lv. for souvenirs."
# If the money saved is less, you need to calculate how much money you need. Then print the following:
# "Sorry. You need {money}lv. more."
# Both numbers should be formatted to the 2nd decimal place.
